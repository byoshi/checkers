Checkers
========

For this assignment, I created a two player Checkers game.  The controls are very intuitive - when it's your turn, you can select one of your pieces by tapping on it to highlight it followed by tapping on a space where you want to move.  Only legal moves are allowed.  You can also jump over your opponent's pieces to capture them and a text field at the top of the screen keeps track of who has captured more pieces.  The following features are NOT implemented:

-King logic

-Checking for no available moves

-Logic to start a new game
